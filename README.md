For now you can play through your favourites, but sometime you will be able to listen to any song and start a radio station from it.
*Soundcloud's related songs endpoint (available in api v2) it's not public yet, so i need to make my own "related" algorithm. That's the tricky part ;)*

## Technology
* React
* Webpack
* Babel
* ES2015
* CSS Modules


## I want to see it!
Sorry, it's not deployed yet, but you can play with it locally:

* Clone this repo
* `npm install` && then `npm start`
* Go to `http://localhost:8080/`
